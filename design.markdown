### Body

Creating our robot we put a great deal of effort in prototyping it on a computer. The initial 3D models were produced in __SolidWorks 3D__. Decomposed body model and its description can be seen here.

### Legs

One of the biggest challenges of designing the robot was designig its leg. We tried to keep the parts as light as possible while maintainig a certain level of robustness. The leg consists of three servo motors which give the endpoint of the lower leg three degrees of freedom. The two servo motors closest to the body were bundeled together in a 3D printed plastic frame to ensure precision of movement of the leg.

### End design

<p>The image on the right represents the final model of all the components of the robot put together. After modeling, we have immersed ourselves in counstruction of the final product. Under the <a href="/construction.html">Construction</a> section you can read all about the manufacturing and assembly of parts.</p>
